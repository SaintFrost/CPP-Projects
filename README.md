# CPP-Projects
I'm trying to learn C++, so these are the projects that I made to learn from scratch.

I'm using JetBrains CLion for coding.

1 - [Basic Calculator](https://github.com/SaintFrost/CPP-Projects/blob/main/BasicCalculator/main.cpp) (Code)

2 - [GPA Calculator](https://github.com/SaintFrost/CPP-Projects/blob/main/GPACalculator/main.cpp) (Code) (For my own courses)

3 - [Temperature Converter](https://github.com/SaintFrost/CPP-Projects/blob/main/TemperatureConverter/main.cpp) (Code)
